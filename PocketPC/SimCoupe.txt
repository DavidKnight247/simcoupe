SimCoupe - A SAM Coupe emulator

Version 1.0, released 21st July 2006


POCKET PC VERSION

SimCoupe uses the Game API (GAPI) for sound and video support. If it's missing from your device you'll get an error when you launch SimCoupe. If that happens, download and install it from the Microsoft site:

The file selectors will only file disk images in your My Documents folder, which can also be on a CF or SD card. Files can also be zipped or gzipped, to help save space.

When the mouse option is enabled, stylus drags on the main screen will move the SAM mouse. Double-tap in the main screen area to click SAM mouse button 1, and continue holding the stylus if you want to drag in the application. Double-tap within the SAM border area to toggle between the default portrait mode and full-screen landscape.

The control pad and hardware buttons can be remapped to different SAM keys in the options. By default the control pad is used for the arrow keys, with the action button generating Return. The hardware buttons defaults are: Q, W, Space, Space. 

There are 10 buttons to the right of the keyboard, which are used as function keys. The function of each also changes depending on whether Shift or Symbol is currently pressed.

In unshifted mode, the function buttons are:

  - Select disk image for drive 1 (used to boot)
  - Select disk image for drive 2
  - Options
  - Toggle joystick SIP
  - Pause
  - Accelerate speed (while held)
  - (unused)
  - About SimCoupe
  - Reset buttom
  - Exit SimCoupe
