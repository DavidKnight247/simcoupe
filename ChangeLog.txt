SimCoupé ChangeLog
==================

Version 0.81 (27th Feb 2001)
----------------------------

- MIDI OUT interrupt timing now perfect (fixes a demo) [Dave Laundon]
- Line interrupt now activated/deactivated on line port writes [Dave Laundon]
- Improved pause feature to halt everything, instead of executing NOPs.
- Support for background running, with optional pause when inactive.

- Selectable screen area (no borders, TV view, full picture scan, ...).
- Automatically accurate mode 3 on just the lines that need it.
- Improved screen change detection for speed-up in most situations.
- Now shows ASIC artefacts for mode 1/2 <=> 3/4 switches.
- Screenshot save in PNG format.
- Optional stretch-to-fit for better use of full-screen space.
- Smarter window resizing to keep aspect, with snap sizes when shift held.
- Improved internal screen handling, including on-screen text.
- Improved mode switching, particularly Alt-TABing from full-screen.

- Support for single file disk images, for easy use of SBT files.
- Multi-sector reads now correctly leave BUSY flag set [fixes SAM Mines].
- Implemented WRITE_TRACK floppy command for disk formatting.
- Floppy 2 LED now replaced with red hard disk LED when ATOM active.

- Mono and stereo parallel DAC sound support.
- Removed DAC optimisation option - now detected automatically.
- Parallel printer support to a windows printer (with manual flush option).
- MIDI-Out to choice of Windows device.
- Spectrum beeper implemented as DAC to sound better on slow systems.
- Fixed quirky SAA sample playback (fixes Space demo on Fred 59) [Dave Hooper]

- Clocks can now advance relative to emulated time as well as real time.
- System time changes now handled at run-time.

- Automatic support for most keyboard mappings.
- Buffered input for better key responses on slower systems.
- Redefineable function keys to assign the choice of emulator actions.
- Turbo key (5fps, no sound), for zooming through slow running programs.
- Temporary key release to avoid ")0"-type problems with key combinations.

- Simpler option presentation with Win32 property sheet.
- Main window now requires left-click before grabbing mouse control.
- Hardware cursor over main window to avoid flicker and slow-down.
- Windows cursor auto-hidden after 3 seconds.
- Windowed mode now maintains the correct aspect ratio.
- Emulator files accessed relative to the main EXE (allows shell associations).


Version 0.80 alpha test 4 (21st Aug 2000)
-----------------------------------------
- Two-step video mode changing, with page change 1 cell after the mode.
- Preliminary mono and stereo DAC support for parallel port 1.
- New DAC optimisation option for better sample plackback on slow machines.
- Support for reading real SAM disks under Windows NT/2000 with SAMDISK.SYS.
- Clock advancing can now be linked to emulated time.
- Improved leap-year detection, instead of just checking multiples of 4.
- AltGr now only optionally for Edit key, as some keyboards use it for symbols.
- Incomplete MIDI messages are discarded, for better resync on new playback.


Version 0.80 alpha test 3 (22nd June 2000)
------------------------------------------
- Much improved contention timing for memory and I/O accesses [Dave Laundon]
- MIDI OUT interrupt now supported [Dave Laundon]
- Interrupt active times now perfect (fixes Defender).

- Hardware overlay support for UYVY, YUY2 and RGB formats.
- Added on-screen floppy activity indicators and status/profile text.

- SAA address now masks unimportant bits before comparing (fixes MOD Player).
- SAA calls no longer cached to allow fix consecutive writes to data port 511.
- MIDI OUT support to the default Windows device.

- Disk save support enabled, as the general disk appears to be reliable.
- Floppy motor now switches off after 10 revolutions of idle.

- Input now updated half way down screen to avoid key bounce side effects.
- Run-time support for Windows keyboard mapping changes.

- Preliminary serial port support for modem use.
- Spectrum mode initialisation now sets up paging/palette as appropriate.
- Disassembler re-written for compactness and complete instruction coverage.


Version 0.80 alpha test (11th Nov 1999)
---------------------------------------
- Crude instruction rounding used to implement approximate memory contention.
- Additional delay and rounding performed on I/O on ASIC-handled ports.
- Improved active duration for interrupts.
- Fixed INI/IND not setting Z flag when B reaches zero (fixes BDOS).
- True 256K base memory configuration now available in addition to 512K.
- HPEN reads now return appropriate line number.
- ATTR reads allow border area detection (on-screen value always zero for now).

- Cell-accurate display updating for much improved display of video effects.
- Screen-off support to allow display disabling through border port.
- 50Hz frame sync using multimedia timer to trigger an event.
- Added full-screen mode and run-time switching to/from windowed mode.
- Added automatic and manual frame skipping.
- Auto fallback of video support to best available mode.
- Corrected flash attribute frequency to every 16 frames (was 25).

- Full SAA/beeper sound support using Dave Hooper's SAASound library.

- Implemented READ_TRACK and READ_ADDRESS commands (fixes SAM DICE).
- Enhanced index pulse, write protect and spin-up floppy controller flags.
- All new disk imlementation for DSK/SAD files (save support disabled for now).
- New SDF image format created to handle copy protected disks.
- Support for gzipped and (read-only) zipped disk images.
- Drag and drop file support to mount disk in drive 1.

- Keyboard and mouse changed to use DirectInput, and joystick support added.
- Preliminary ATOM hard disk emulation to give basic BDOS 1.4e support.
- Fast boot option temporarily modifies the SAM ROMs for an instant boot.
- Auto-boot option to automatically press F9 on bootup.
- SAMBUS and DALLAS clocks supported.

Version 0.80 pre-pre-alpha (8th Mar 1999)
-----------------------------------------
- Quick and dirty port, changing as little as possible to get code to run.
- Added DirectX windowed display support for 8, 16 and 32-bit modes.
- Added basic Win32 keyboard and mouse implementation.

27th Feb 1999
-------------
Started porting the X version of SimCoupé 0.72 to Win32.
